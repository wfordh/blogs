			<p>My aim for this section of my writing is to focus on common data science ideas and techniques that don't require full blog posts like what you will find on Medium or other sites. Instead it will concern smaller ideas or methods that may be mentioned within longer posts or that you might come across while thinking through a project. I am not planning on detailing how to implement algorithms, or even how a full algorithm comes together, but might shed some light on important steps in algorithms whose concepts are either very important or not wholly unique to a single algorithm.</p>
			<p>I hope this will help not only my own understanding of these topics, but yours as well. I believe it is helpful to understand the core concepts behind our powerful models, though you may not need to know the ugly calculus or linear algebra behind them. The topics listed below are what I hope to cover first, though not necessarily in order.</p>
			<ul type="square">
				<li>
					Bias/Variance tradeoff
				</li>
				<li>
					Precision, recall, and related measures
				</li>
				<li>
					What makes a model parametric (or non-parametric) and examples of each
				</li>
