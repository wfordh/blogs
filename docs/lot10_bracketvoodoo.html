        		Lot 10 Sports and Bracket Voodoo are two branches of one sports analytics consulting firm where Lot 10 focuses on NCAA football and Bracket Voodoo concentrates on NCAA basketball, especially March Madness. I interned with these companies as part of the MSDS program at USF, and I worked on projects for both arms of the company. You can find their full work on their websites, with links below.
